# calorie-tracker
This is the first larger project I’ve created, I’d love any feedback or input. It started as what I thought would be a small learning project and it turned into something a bit bigger than expected!

## Installing

Since moving to react v17 error corrupts npm installs so yarn is required for now

```console
$ cd calorie-tracker
$ npm i
$ cd client_web
$ yarn install 
$ cd ..
$ cd api
$ npm i
```
### /api/.env Example

```console
PORT=5000
DB_URI=
APP_SECRET=shhhhhhhh
```

## Running

```console
$ cd calorie-tracker
$ npm start
```
